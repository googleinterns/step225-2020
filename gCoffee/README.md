# gCoffee

gCoffee is a simple coffee shop app created to explore third-party appsâ€™ integration with Google Assistant via App Actions.
The app allows users to order coffee and collect reward points.
Integrating it with Google Assistant will enable users to perform both actions (ordering a drink and checking points balance) directly from the Assistant.
